benefits of using cloud services 
High availability withouth any downtime benefit
faulty tolerance/ backup in the nearest region
agility // ability to react quickly. 
Scalability/ increase the resources, perform the opration inthe manual fashion
elasticity- peroform the operations in the automatic fashio
Disaster recovery -- 
latency - slowness, network issue. jitter. 
whenever app is facing slowness latency. high availability
fault tolerance.
productivity - 
global reach - reach the audienc across the globe/ 
security identitiy access management control// level off access control

economies of scale -- the "ability" to reduce costs and gain efficieny
